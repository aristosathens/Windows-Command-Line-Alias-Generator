Command Line tool for alias assignment

This offers advantages over DOSKEY and other methods:
-Automatic. Don't need to manually add .bat/.cmd files and don't need to add directories to system path.
-Persistent. Aliases remain after closing out of cmd console.
-Organized. Let's you view/add/delete aliases all in one place.
